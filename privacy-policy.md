## List of "USER DATA" collected

| Reason        | Use Case           |
| :-------------: |:-------------:|
| Individual Rate-Limiting      | This means if you were to spam commands, we can prevent spam by blocking your command based on your User ID.  | 
| Debugging Broken Commands      | If a command you execute has an error, Skyglass logs the error with your Username, Command Context and User ID.  | 
| Monitoring Mis-Use of Skyglass      | If someone is attempting to use Skyglass maliciously we can detect and stop it based on how many commands have been executed by that User ID in a certain timespan.  | 
| Statistical Information      | This refers to how many people are using Skyglass, how many people are using a certain command etc based on the command you executed (Command Context)  |
